# Stick-Project-1

This project is an open exploration into making my own joysticks for PC gaming.  The end goal is to have a 3 axis dual stick and split dual throttle setup, to document the journey, and have directions for replicating the end product

# Resurecting Old Sticks

Old stick is a Saitek ST220, I had to replace the internal board with an Arduino Micro Pro micro controller in order to make the stick work on modern PC's
After I removed the old board I looked at the wiring to figure out which wires were ground, 5v, and signal.  I pinned the wire's using a kit I cannot rememeber
name of (Replace next week).  Then attached the wires to the corresponding spots on the micro pro, plugged it in and it's back up and running.

Old stick number two is a Saitek Pacific aviator for PS3.  Going to be replacing the internal board with another micro pro.
